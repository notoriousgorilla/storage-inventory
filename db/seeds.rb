# This file should contain all the record creation needed to seed the database with its default values.
# The data can then be loaded with the rails db:seed command (or created alongside the database with db:setup).
#
# Examples:
#
#   movies = Movie.create([{ name: 'Star Wars' }, { name: 'Lord of the Rings' }])
#   Character.create(name: 'Luke', movie: movies.first)

#a1 = Furniture.create(name: "Barstool", image: 'design_chair_1.png', description: "Ipsum", storage_count: 4) 
#a2 = Furniture.create(name: "VKAD-pult", image: 'design_chair_1.png', description: "Lorem", storage_count: 5)

#b1 = Location.create(storage_name: "B2kropp", description: "Lorem")
#b2 = Location.create(storage_name: "VIP-Lager", description: "Ipsum")

#b1.furniture << [a1, a2]
#b2.furniture << [a2]
